        our defense of these claims. You agree not to settle any matter without

      <Typography align={"center"} variant={"h1"}>Assumption of Risk</Typography>
      <Typography><br /></Typography>
      <Typography>
        You accept and acknowledge that you are solely responsible for determining
        what, if any, taxes apply to your purchases and sales on the Smart
        Contract. Plottables is not responsible for determining the taxes that
        apply to your Smart Contract transactions. By making any purchases, you
        are purchasing ownership of a token hash that is stored on the Ethereum
        blockchain and used to generate artwork. The site does not store, send, or
        receive tokens. The source code used to generate artwork from your token
        hash is stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Under no circumstances do you
        have ownership of this source code. Plottables is not responsible for any
        bugs, exploits, or hacks. We cannot guarantee that the Site or Smart
        Contract is free of bugs or errors. There are risks associated with
        accepting cryptocurrencies as payment and purchasing blockchain based
        Tokens, including but not limited to, the risk of losing private keys,
        theft of cryptocurrency or Tokens due to hackers finding out your private
        key, lack of a secondary market, significant price volatility, hard forks
        and disruptions to the Ethereum blockchain. You accept and acknowledge
        that transfers on the Ethereum blockchain are irreversible and as a
        result, it is not possible for Plottables to issue refunds on Token
        purchases.

      <Typography>
        You hereby release and forever discharge Plottables (and our officers,
        employees, agents, successors, and assigns) from, and hereby waive and
        relinquish, each and every past, present and future dispute, claim,
        controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action and cause of
        action of every kind and nature (including personal injuries, death, and
        property damage), that has arisen or arises directly or indirectly out of,
        or that relates directly or indirectly to, the Application. If you are a
        California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542
        in connection with the foregoing, which states: "A general release does
        not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or
        suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release
        and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or
        her settlement with the debtor or released party."

      <Typography align={"center"} variant={"h1"}>Limitation of Liability</Typography>
      <Typography><br /></Typography>
      <Typography>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall Plottables be
        liable to you or any third party for any lost profits, lost data, or any
        indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive
        damages arising from or relating to these terms of use or your use of, or
        inability to use, the site, even if Plottables has been advised of the
        possibility of such damages. Access to, and use of, the site is at your
        own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage
        to your device or computer system, or loss of data resulting therefrom.
        Plottables shall not be liable for any loss or damage as a result of your
        failure to keep your wallet secure. Plottables shall not liable for any
        loss or damage arising from your failure to maintain the confidentiality
        of your financial information, which includes your private keys. To the
        maximum extent permitted by law, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
        contained herein, our liability to you for any damages arising from or
        related to this agreement (for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the
        form of the action), will at all times be limited to a maximum of fifty us
        dollars (u.s. $50). The existence of more than one claim will not enlarge
        this limit. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of
        liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation
        or exclusion may not apply to you.
